# Introduction

**Assimbly** is a messaging gateway. 

The gateway acts as a link between endpoints, allow them to share information and bypass certain protocols. The purpose of Assimbly is to configure and manage these endpoints with the help of a webgui.

On the background [Apache Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel) does the actual work. Assimbly can connect
many Camel components.
